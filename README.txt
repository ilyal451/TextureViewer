Texture Viewer is an image viewer designed for the use in game development. It can view textures as well as the source images.

It is SSE and thread optimized and supports plugin extension.

The current drawbacks: it is 32-bit only (the work on a 64-bit version is unfinised).

Some of the features:
- Display separate channels and tiling
- S3TC BC6-7 support (via the DDS format currently)
- Support texture arrays, MIP-maps, 3D textures
- File management (allows you to mark the files as you're viewing them, and then to do some operations on them: cut, copy, delete; also it can export a file list)

- The idea was inspired by the Windows Texture Viewer (WTV, a tool by NVIDIA)
